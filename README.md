# Respuestas a "Los Imposibles"

## What is this?

This is a small website in blog format that I use to reply ideas, comments and arguments in Whats App group I have with friends about Spanish, European and Word politics and anything interesting or worth discussing.  The title is in Spanish and could be translated  as "*Reply to Impossibles*", since the group is called  "*Impossibles' Club*" in Spanish ("*Club de los Imposibles*"). 

## Why?

Well, the main reason because I trying to reply through things mean is because it doesn't feel right to reply and discuss about some topics over  Whats App either, on mobile or in the website, so I set up this small page. The idea is to write longer and more meaningful replies to their ideas and to strive dialog and discussion in a more relevant way. 

## Note

The site isn't private, but it isn't indexed by web crawlers. I don't want to hide anything I publish here, but I don't want to publicize the site and try to keep it for the use of the group mainly.
